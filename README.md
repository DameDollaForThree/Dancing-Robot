**Goal**: build and program a dancing robot using ***Arduino C***.

The robot is able to:
- **dance** (code designed by SunFounder, not us)
- **move forward**, and **move backward** when it senses an obstacle within 5 cm (code designed by us)   

**Main components**: an Arduino UNO board, a breadboard, four micro-servos, and an ultrasonic distance sensor
